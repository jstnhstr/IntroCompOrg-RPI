# Boolean Algebra Operations

## 1. Here is a program that simply reads characters from the keyboard until the user hits the enter (or return) key. Add code to the program so that it allows the user to enter up to a 32-bit integer in hexadecimal and converts the number to int format. Your algorithm should make use of the masking operation described above. The program should display the int in both hexadecimal and decimal format for the user. Assume that the user will not make mistakes.
